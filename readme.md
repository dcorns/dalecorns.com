###An interesting web site
####openshift deployment:
 standard: `rhc app create 'dalecorns' nodejs-0.10 --from-code=https://github.com/dcorns/dalecorns.com.git`

use latest node version and mongodb: https://github.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/

`rhc app create 'dalecorns' https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-nodejs/master/metadata/manifest.yml --from-code=https://github.com/dcorns/dalecorns.com.git https://raw.githubusercontent.com/icflorescu/openshift-cartridge-mongodb/master/metadata/manifest.yml`

####openshift update
`git remote add openshift ssh://`openshift-git-url<br/>
Get the git url: `rhc show-app` ' APP_NAME<br/>
Add the marker file `hot_deploy` to skip server restart on deployment: `touch .openshift/markers/hot_deploy`<br/>
Now you can update using `git push openshift master`
####Connect to openshift mongo database from shell
`rhc port-forward` APP_NAME
####Connect to openshift using shell
`rhc ssh -a` APP_NAME
###Alternate Firebase Setup
Create a firebase account and application<br/>
Go to application settings, permissions, service account<br/>
Create Service Account Using the following settings:<br/>
Furnish new key, Key type JSON<br/>
Give the account a name and leave everything else at defaults, then click **CREATE**<br/>
A json file with credentials will be downloaded to the local machine
####Setup access to firebase in node
Edit ~/.bash_profile:<br/>
export FIREBASE='*contents of json file*'<br/>
export FIREBASE_DB='*appName*.firebaseio.com'<br/>
Make available in app:
`var firebaseCredentials = JSON.parse(process.env.FIREBASE);`
<br/>
`require('firebase')`<br/>
see server.ts for remaining details
#####Add evs to openshift
Because the custom environment variables on openshift are limited to 512 characters a method for breaking the firebase secret up into multiple variables must be employed. Using  the usefulFunctions.breakUpString function, break the firebase private key into strings of 500 characters or less. Then create environment variables for each one in openshift.
rhc env set FIREBASE_KEY1='*partOfKey*' -a *openshiftAppName* (etc.)<br/>
In the same manner provide variables for email, project Id and database(see server.ts)<br/>
rhc env set FIREBASE_DB='*appName*.firebaseio.com' -a *openshiftAppName*<br/>
Verify variables: rhc env list -a *openshiftAppName*
####Testing Firebase Data access
set fire base rules wide open
```
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "true",
    ".write": "true"
  }
}
```
####Development Flow
For development gulp and grunt is used. Gulp is used to call grunt indirectly.
#####Gulp Tasks
######watcher
Running `gulp watcher` will insure that all the css is converted from 4 to 3 and combined into one file, insure that the all the Java Script is converted from ES6 to 5 and combined into one file, insures that all the html views are converted to JavaScript, and keeps Development/index.html in up to date with app/index.html.
####Deployment
`gulp ship` transfers the contents of Development to public for git deployment to openshift `git push openshift master`
#####Useful OpenShift commands
`rhc tail -a dalecorns` Output logs to terminal in real time. `ctl_app status` Run in ssh session to show status of gears more accurately than the OpenShift console. `ctl_all start` Start application and dependencies.
#####AWS Deployment
######Create new VPC for a separate public ip
######Launch a new instance of RedHat enterprise linux on new VPC
######Add security rules for HTTP, HTTPS, and SSH traffic
######Create or choose SSH key
######Connect to new instance via SSH or the AWS CLI
Get the instance ID from the EC2 console or with describe-instances using the CLI<br/>
Get the public DNS from the EC2 console or using describe-instances using the CLI<br/>
Locate the the pem file that was downloaded when the SSH key was created or chosen<br/>
AWS instructs us to connect like this:
`ssh -i /path/my-key-pair.pem ec2-user@ec2-198-51-100-1.compute-1.amazonaws.com`<br/>
It does not work.<br/>
Do this instead:<br/>
Connecting to EC2 instance:
Connect using Putty, or PuTTY. It is an SSH and telnet client that can be used to connect to your remote Linux instances. Make sure you have the tool called PuttyGen to create your private key (*.ppk).<br/>
Run this command: `puttygen <theAWS.pemFile> -o <nameForPuttyKey>.ppk`<br/>
Open putty and put the ec2 domain name or ip address provided on the instance dashboard into the appropriate field.<br/>
Navigate to connection>SSH>Auth in the category tree and and highlight it.<br/>
Browse for the key created above and verify it is trusted when the prompted.<br/>
Go back to the session part of the tree, give the session a name and save it for future use.<br/>
Click open. Login as ec2-user.<br/>
Click the x to close.<br/>
######Install supporting software
`sudo yum install git`
Install node with 'n' version control: This command will set both PREFIX and N_PREFIX to $HOME/n, installs n to $HOME/n/bin, modifies the initialization files of supported shells to export N_PREFIX and add $HOME/n/bin to the PATH, and installs the latest stable node version. `curl -L http://git.io/n-install | bash`</br>
Update npm to latest version `npm install -g npm`<br/>
